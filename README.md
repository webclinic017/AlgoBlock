# AlgoBlock

AlgoBlock is a web app dedicated to making stock trading simpler. This allows users to use drop-down menus to create a trading strategy and converts these drop-downs into code. Users can then run that code to trade stocks automatically.

You can view the main source code here:
- [Source Folder](/src/pages/Home.jsx)

The production version is hosted here:
- [https://algoblock-4a1c4.web.app](https://algoblock-4a1c4.web.app)

## Running Locally

## Deploying

In order to deploy a new version of this website, you can run the following command:
